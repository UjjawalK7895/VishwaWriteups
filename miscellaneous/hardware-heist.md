### Hardware Heist

### Description
Your cyber gang has stolen a hardware device code from the CIA but are unable to use it. Although while stealing the code, you have found some binary strings which might be helpful to understand the device. You might even find the important codes after solving the device and strings.

### Writeup
We got 2 files in this chall binary_input.txt and zip file which was related to some hardware type of shit. I firstly went to the contents of the zip file but it didn't made any sense so i then moved to binary_input.txt which contained a binary string i simply copied and pasted it into ascii-code on [decode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code) and got the flag.
