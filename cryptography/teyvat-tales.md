# Teyvat Tales

## DESCRIPTION
All tavern owners in Mondstadt are really worried because of the frequent thefts in the Dawn Winery cellars. The Adventurers’ Guild has decided to secure the cellar door passwords using a special cipher device. But the cipher device itself requires various specifications….which the guild decided to find out by touring the entire Teyvat.

PS: The Guild started from the sands of Deshret then travelled through the forests of Sumeru and finally to the cherry blossoms of Inazuma
