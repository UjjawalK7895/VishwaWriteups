### Try Hack Me

#### Description
```txt
TryHackMe is a browser-based cyber security training platform, with learning content covering all skill levels from the complete beginner to the seasoned hacker.

One of our team member is very active on the platform. Recently, I got to know that he comes under 3% in the global leaderboard. Impressive isn't it.

Maybe you should have a look at his profile

PS : He keeps his digital identity very simple. No fancy usernames. It's just a simple mathematics

His real name == His username
```

#### Writeup
Since his username was his real name, I went on to google to search for vishwactf and found the tech team on their website https://vishwactf.com/team/team.html.

Then I tried every person's name on tryhackme by https://tryhackme.com/p/username.

And using the name Ankush Kaudi in place of username, opened the profile with the flag in description.

#### FLAG : `VishwaCTF{Pr0f1l3_1dent1fi3d_v0uch3r5_cr3d1t3d_5ucc355fully}'
